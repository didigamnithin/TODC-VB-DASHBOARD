### Key Metrics for Analysis
- **Overall Subtotal**: Sum of "Subtotal" column (filtered for Order type and Delivered status)

### Filter Requirements
- **Transaction type**: "Order" only
- **Final order status**: "Delivered" only
- **Date field**: Use "Timestamp local date" for date filtering

## Data Relationships

### Store Matching
Both datasets use "Store name" and "Store ID" to identify stores. The marketing data contains more stores than the financial data, indicating some stores may have marketing campaigns but no financial transactions in the given date range.

### Date Ranges
- Marketing data: 2025-09-22 to 2025-10-05
- Financial data: 2025-09-30 to 2025-10-06
- Overlap period: 2025-09-30 to 2025-10-05

### Unique Values
- **Marketing Self-Serve**: True/False
- **Financial Transaction Types**: Order, Error Charge, Fee, Adjustment
- **Financial Order Status**: Delivered, Picked Up, Cancelled (various types)

## Notes for Dashboard Implementation
1. Use "Date" column for marketing data date filtering
2. Use "Timestamp local date" column for financial data date filtering
3. Filter financial data by Transaction type = "Order" and Final order status = "Delivered"
4. Store names may have slight variations between datasets - consider fuzzy matching if needed
5. All monetary values are in USD
6. ROAS calculation: Sales / (Marketing fees + Customer discounts funded by you)
